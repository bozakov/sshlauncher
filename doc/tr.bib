  abstract       = {In this paper we present results from an extensive
                   measurement study of wireless bandwidth estimation in
                   IEEE 802.11 WLANs using the distributed coordination
                   function. We show that a number of known iterative
                   probing methods, which are based on the assumption of
                   first-come first-serve scheduling, can be expected to
                   report the fair bandwidth share of a new flow rather
                   than the available bandwidth. Our measurement results
                   confirm this view and we conclude that under the
                   current probe gap and probe rate models the fair share
                   can only be loosely related to the available bandwidth.
                   Like a few other studies we report that packet sizes
                   have a tremendous impact on bandwidth estimates. Unlike
                   these studies we can, however, how that minor
                   modifications to known methods for wired networks, such
                   as Pathload, can solve previously indicated limitations
                   of these methods in wireless networks. },
