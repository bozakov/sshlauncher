Summary:

Simulation and emulation experiments are widely used for investigating
new approaches and verifying existing theories in communication
networks. In this report, we present a tool for performing automated
experiments in distributed testbeds such as Emulab or PlanetLab. Using
an intuitive configuration file syntax, large sets of complex command
sequences can be executed with minimal user interaction. As a result,
the repeated execution of experiments and the generation of
controlled, documented, and reproducible results is greatly
facilitated.

Installation:

You will have to install the pexpect package first. 
For a system-wide SSHLauncher installation do

  python setup.py install

you will probably require root privileges. However, SSHLauncher can 
also be executed as a stand alone application from the local directory.

Usage:

  sshlauncher [-d] configfile

Please refer to the included PDF file for detailed instructions on setting 
up the configuration file.
